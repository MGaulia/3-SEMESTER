Do we need another book full of war and mortal cruelty?
Julian Stallabrass leaves the reader in no doubt of this quandary in Memory of Fire: Images of War and the War of Images. 
Vasily Grossman's story of the Red Army's jocular propping of frozen German soldiers' corpses is equated by Stallabrass' to his task displaying war photographs throughout the 2008 Brighton Photo Biennial; akin to stacking bodies to make something meaningful.
Images of War and their use as agents of warfare (the War of Images) are the two sides of the same coin; throughout, this author of Art Incorporated (2004) confronts their corporate/industrial, mercenary potential.
Spreads of confronting war images, some unhappily familiar, each vividly introduces a chapter of the book.
An episode of Eduardo Galeano's Memory of Fire, itself a story of lost history, serves to remind us of the vital preservative value of the archive, and its vulnerability to destruction or revision.
Should we lose these records of conflict, will history repeat itself without our knowing? The pornography of war is irresistible.
There is a masochist rush in exposing oneself to the images included here; how 'gruesome/awesome' (to quote, from page 51, Evan Wright of Rolling Stone magazine) is it to witness the perennial opening image Abu Ghraib 11.51 pm Nov 7 2003 ?
Does it make us involuntarily complicit in an act like that described by Grossman? Stallabrass shrewdly discriminates complexities in images of violence, revealing conflicts between their instrumentality and aesthetics which occupied him in curating the 2008 Biennial.
Regrettably, the same year saw the passing of Philip Jones-Griffith, whose Vietnam Inc. is one sure instance in which images changed the course of a war.
With the aim of scrutinising art, document and ethics in extremis, Stallabrass asks Jones-Griffith whether he oriented Vietnam Inc. 'while taking the pictures' or as prompted by anti-war sentiment, eliciting the arresting reply; 'I distrusted them [...] suspicious of those weekend, armchair communists'! Equally principled and fiercely independent are Rita Leistner's and Ashley Gibertson's frank accounts of the embedded vs. the 'unilateral' photojournalist with deep perplexity over the compromises in either means of accessing a war, alongside insights into the aesthetics of flash or of typological portraits.
Most impressive are these photographers' demonstrations of high-stakes political potentials of relations between soldier, civilian, photographer and audience, and their steadfast belief in honesty despite the change in status of embedded journalists to targets of local anger and the undervaluing, misrepresentation or ignoring of their images by their editors.
At the heart of the book is the consideration of art in representing, rather than documenting, war. Questioning whether '[social] documentary photography is [any] longer...capable of representing today's technological warfare', Sarah James considers the failure or success of a 'people-less' 'aftermath photography' practicing a romanticising aesthetic of the ruin, to summon Adorno's political sublime. Less equivocal, more sinister, Trevor Paglen's remote imaging of US militaryâ€“industrial black sites and spy satellites; espionage in an intriguing evidential/aesthetic relationship with heat mirages.
Oliver Chanarin's and Adam Broomberg's acknowledgement of earlier failure to 'represent any of the trauma' of soldiers' injuries led to their eschewing conventional documentation.
In their now notorious seriesThe Day that Nobody Died they adopt the conceptual, pragmatic strategy of exposing a roll of photographic paper directly to 'front line' Afghanistani light and filming British troops, with whom they were embedded, carrying the heavy cardboard box containing it.
Stallabrass queries why the resulting prints are portents of destruction, while the video is comic; their response reveals how taking performance art to the theatre of war might be legitimate.
